							Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost
							unorthographic life One
							day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for
							the far World of
							Grammar.

							Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia,
							there live the
							blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics,
							a large language
							ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary
							regelialia.
							<br>
							<br>
							The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
							Question Marks and
							devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. On her way she met a copy.
							The copy warned the
							Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times
							and everything that
							was left from its origin would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn
							around and return to
							its own, safe country.
